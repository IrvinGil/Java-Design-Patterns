# Structural Design Patterns
**Structural Design Patterns** are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
The structural design pattern **simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.**

These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed for other classes.

## Types of Structural Design Patterns
1. [Adapter Pattern](./adapterpattern/patterndescription/AdapterPattern.md) - Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation.
2. [Bridge Pattern](./bridgepattern/patterndescription/BridgePattern.md) - Separating abstraction (interface) from implementation.
3. [Composite Pattern](./compositepattern/patterndescription/CompositePattern.md) - Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects.
4. [Decorator Pattern](./decoratorpattern/patterndescription/DecoratorPattern.md) - Adding functionality to an object dynamically.
5. [Facade Pattern](./facadepattern/patterndescription/FacadePattern.md) - Providing an interface to a set of interfaces.
6. [Flyweight Pattern](./flyweightpattern/patterndescription/FlyweightPattern.md) - Reusing an object by sharing it.
7. [Proxy Pattern](./proxypattern/patterndescription/ProxyPattern.md) - Representing another object.
