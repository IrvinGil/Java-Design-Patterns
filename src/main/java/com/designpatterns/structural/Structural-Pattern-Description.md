# Structural Design Patterns
**Structural Design Patterns** are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
The structural design pattern **simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.**

These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed for other classes.

## Types of Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter Pattern - Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation.
2. Bridge Pattern - Separating abstraction (interface) from implementation.
3. Composite Pattern - Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects.
4. Decorator Pattern - Adding functionality to an object dynamically.
5. Facade Pattern - Providing an interface to a set of interfaces.
6. Flyweight Pattern - Reusing an object by sharing it.
7. Proxy Pater - Representing another object.
