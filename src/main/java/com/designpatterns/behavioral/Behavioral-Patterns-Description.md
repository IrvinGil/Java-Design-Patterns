# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with **the interaction and responsibility of objects**.

In these design patterns, **the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled**. That means that the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order avoid hard coding and dependencies.

## There are 12 types of behavioral design patterns
